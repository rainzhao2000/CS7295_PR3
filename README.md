# OMSCS-CS7295 Project-3: GPU Warp Scheduling
In this assignment, you will have two main goals: 
1. Introduce compute and tensor cores to simulate compute operation latencies to include execution of non-memory operations such as add and multiply.
2. Implement different warp scheduling algorithms on a GPU simulator which will give you an 
opportunity to learn how warp scheduling algorithms affect the performance of a GPU program.

For ease of implementation and grading we have separated the goals into tasks which are explained further in this README.


## Goal 1: Implement Compute and Tensor cores
### Compute Core
In this stage, all instructions - both non-memory and memory - are executed. The compute core is responsible for determining 
the latency of non-memory operations, such as add and multiply, and accessing caches for memory operations. 
It plays a crucial role in simulating the overall performance of GPU programs by accounting for compute operation latencies.

### Tensor Core
NVIDIA Tensor Cores serve as dedicated accelerators for matrix multiplication operations, particularly in artificial intelligence computations. 
They offer significantly higher throughput compared to CUDA Cores, making them essential for accelerating AI applications. 
Tensor Cores excel in performing matrix multiplications efficiently, contributing to improved performance in tasks dominated by GEMM operations.
Tensor cores are expensive, so modern GPUs adopt a subcore concept: one SM contains 4 subcores, each responsible for one warp and equipped with one tensor core, for a total of 4 tensor cores per SM.

### Differences
While the compute core handles one-dimensional point-by-point calculations, the tensor core is optimized for two-dimensional tile-by-tile calculations. 
This difference in computation approach reflects their respective strengths in processing different types of operations efficiently.

### Traces
For Goal #1, we will utilize two traces: gemm_float and gemm_half.
- gemm_float is intended for the compute core.
- gemm_half is intended for the tensor core.
It's crucial to note the disparities in the number of instructions and opcodes between the two traces. NVbit is employed for trace generation. 
gemm_half incorporates HMMA instructions, indicating tensor (float16) operations, while gemm_float predominantly employs FFMA instructions. 
In gemm_half traces, HMMA opcodes are in the form "HMMA.1688.F16," signifying the use of Float16 operands. 
However, it's worth mentioning that macsim does not utilize the flags that follow the opcode.

## Assignment Tasks
### Task-1: Implement Naive Compute Core
To begin with, you'll need to implement a basic compute core functionality within the `core.cpp` file. The `run_a_cycle()` function, 
called each cycle, will now handle compute instructions instead of disregarding them. Here's what your code should accomplish:

1. **Identify Compute Instructions:** Check whether an instruction is a compute instruction and retrieve its latency.
2. **Buffer Compute Instructions:** If the instruction is indeed a compute instruction, add it to the `c_exec_buffer` data structure (per core) along with its completion cycle timestamp.
4. **Handle Buffer Fullness:** If the buffer reaches its capacity, then stall the warp.
5. **Execute Instructions from Buffer:** Periodically, check whether the current cycle timestamp exceeds the completion timestamp of any instructions in the buffer. If so, remove these instructions from the buffer.

> Hint: Look for "// TODO: Task 1" comments!

### Task-2: Extend to Tensor Core
In this task, we extend the compute core to simulate tensor-core-like behavior.
Tensor operations (opcodes starting with `H`, e.g., `HMMA`) and non-tensor ALU operations should be treated **differently** when they enter the execution buffer:

- **Tensor instructions** go through a *width-limited* execution buffer that models the small number of dedicated tensor units per sub-core. When the buffer is full, the issuing warp must stall.
- **Non-tensor compute instructions** (basic ALU ops) are *always* added to the buffer for register-dependency tracking only. Real GPUs have abundant INT32/FP32 ALU lanes, so they are not capacity-bound at this granularity.

Below is the tensor configuration to be simulated:

| Latency (cycles) | Execution Width (tensor) |
|------------------|--------------------------|
| 64               | 1                        |

The latency above applies only to tensor instructions; other compute instructions use the default latency of 1.
For report purposes, you can explore varying the tensor operator's latency (32-128) and execution width (2-16).
The reduced number of instructions in tensor operations allows for adjustments in latency or limits on the number of operations. Analyzing these trade-offs will provide valuable insights.

It's worth noting that the trace generation has already accounted for tensor operations, resulting in fewer instructions (observe the `NUM_INSTRS_RETIRED` statistic for both traces).

> Hint: Look for "// TODO: Task 2" comments!

> Hint: Tensor instruction opcodes start with "H*".

Moreover, given the extended duration of compute instructions, it's crucial to address register dependencies to prevent hazards.
Therefore, the RR scheduling scheme should be revised to consider register dependencies within a warp when determining the scheduling of warps.
- While macsim can handle multiple destination registers for an instruction, the provided traces feature only one destination register, simplifying dependency checks.
- Iterate through warps to schedule one without dependencies in a round-robin manner.
- For simplicity, warps with empty trace buffers, which are refilled after scheduling, can be disregarded for dependency checks.

## Goal 2: Warp Scheduling in GPUs
Warp is a group of threads that execute the same instruction parallelly on different data. GPUs dynamically schedule 
warps to the available cores in each cycle in a fine-grained multi-threaded manner. Essentially, a GPU core has multiple
warp contexts and in each cycle, the fetch stage of GPU fetches an instruction from a different warp. This helps the GPU
to hide the latency of a long-running event such as memory access. The warp scheduler orchestrates the scheduling of warps 
on a core using various scheduling policies. An efficient scheduling algorithm ensures better utilization of resources, 
minimizing stall times and maximizing throughput. 

### Warp Scheduling Algorithms
#### Round Robin
In the round-robin scheduling algorithm, the scheduler cyclically schedules warps from the active warps pool (dispatch queue 
in macsim) each cycle.
- Ensures equal distribution of GPU time to all the warps.
- May cause more cache misses.

#### Greedy then Oldest
In greedy then oldest scheduling algorithm, the scheduler will pick the same warp every cycle until there is a long 
latency event, in which case, it switches to another warp. 
- Reduces overall stall times.
- Better utilization of cache. 

#### Simplified Cache-Conscious Wavefront Scheduling (CCWS) 
In this algorithm, the number of scheduled warps is dynamically reduced to enhance cache locality. While decreasing the 
number of scheduled warps may impact thread-level parallelism, CCWS relies on a runtime monitoring mechanism to mitigate this effect. 

## Assignment Tasks
### Task-3: Implement Greedy then Oldest Scheduler
A function outline for implementing the GTO scheduler is available in `core.cpp::schedule_warps_gto()`. This function is 
called each cycle by the scheduler (implemented in `core.cpp::run_a_cycle()` and `core.cpp::schedule_warps()`). To 
schedule a warp for execution using GTO your code must do the following things:
1. Check if the last scheduled warp is still in the active warps pool, if yes, schedule it again.
2. If not, search through all the warps in the active warps pool and schedule the oldest one.

> Hint: You must implement a per-warp timestamp marker and update it when a block is scheduled and the block's warps are dispatched to a core (see the task in macsim class).

> Hint: look for "// TODO: Task 3" comments!

### Task-4: Simplified Cache-Conscious Wavefront Scheduler
In this task, you will implement the Cache-Conscious Wavefront Scheduling (CCWS) Algorithm under Round Robin. 

The CCWS scheme tries to provide a warp with more exclusive access to the cache by limiting the number of warps that
can be scheduled on the core. The goal of the scheme is to increase the intra-warp (aka wavefront) locality. 
Each warp is given a *Lost Locality Score* (LLS) based on how much intra-warp locality it has lost. The warps 
in the dispatch queue are then sorted in descending order of the LLS scores and the group of warps whose 
cumulative scores are within the *Cumulative LLS cutoff* (starting from the beginning) are allowed to be 
scheduled by the underlying scheduler (Round Robin in this case). the LLS scores are assigned to warps by 
using a feedback mechanism from the cache.

In our implementation, for each warp(`macsim.h::warp_s`), we keep an instance of the 
`ccws_vta.h::ccws_vta` class to stimulate that warp's VTA entry. VTA class simulates a fully-associative 
[victim cache](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victim_cache) with LRU replacement policy and is used to 
store the evicted tags from L1 cache. We also use a variable in `macsim.h::warp_s` to keep 
track of a warp's LLS score and assign its value to the base LLS score when the warp is dispatched.

To implement CCWS your code must do the following things:

**Setting up the feedback mechanism from the cache subsystem:** 
1. While repairing an L1 cache miss, a line from L1 cache could get evicted. In this case, we need to insert the tag
  corresponding to the evicted line address in corresponding warp's VTA entry. **[Task 4.1a and 4.1b]**

> In macsim, L1 cache insertion (and potentially eviction) happens in the following 2 cases:
>  - **L1 Miss, L2 hit**: In this case L1 can evict a line when it repairs the miss by getting data from the l2 cache.
>  - **L1 Miss, L2 Miss**:  In this case, a memory request is sent and when the response is returned, the data gets
>  inserted in both L1 and L2 caches. 

2. Whenever there is a miss in the L1 cache, check if the tag is present in the VTA, if yes (VTA Hit!), increment the
  VTA hits counter and update the LLS score for the warp. **[Task 4.2a and 4.2b]**  
  `LLS = ( VTA_Hits_Total * K_Throttle * Cum_LLS_Cutoff) / Num_Instr` where:
    - `Cum_LLS_Cutoff = Num_Active_Warps * Base_Locality_Score`
    - *VTA_Hits_Total* is the number of VTA hits across all warps on the core.
    - *K_Throttle* is the throttling parameter (value is given in `macsim.h`).
    - *Num_Active_Warps* is the number of warps currently on the core (see `get_running_warp_num()`).
    - *Base_Locality_Score* is the base locality score (value is given in `macsim.h`).

> Note: LLS score cannot be less than the Base LLS score for any warp at any point in time, you need to enforce this
> while updating the LLS scores.

3. In each cycle decrease the LLS scores by 1 for all the warps in the core (running, active, and suspended) until they 
  reach the minimum value equal to the `Base_Locality_Score`. **[Task 4.3]**

**Implementing CCWS Scheduler:**  
4. The outline for implementing the CCWS is available in `core.cpp::schedule_warps_ccws()`. 
  - Determine the Cumulative LLS cutoff value using: `Cum_LLS_Cutoff = Num_Active_Warps * Base_Locality_Score` **[Task 4.4a]**

  - Construct the set of warps from the dispatch queue which are allowed to be scheduled (*scheduleable set*): **[Task 4.4b]**
    - Create a copy of the dispatch queue, and sort it in descending order.
    - Collect the the warps with highest LLS scores (until we reach the cumulative cutoff) to construct the *scheduleable warps* set.
  
  - Use Round Robin as baseline scheduling logic to schedule warps from the dispatch queue only if the warp is present
    in the *scheduleable warps* set. **[Task 4.4c]**

## Macsim Simulator
This simulator is a stripped-down version of the original [Macsim](https://sites.gatech.edu/hparch/software/#macsim) simulator 
developed by [HpArch Lab](https://sites.gatech.edu/hparch/) at GT. It is a trace-based simulator where traces for various 
benchmarks are captured using [NVBit](https://research.nvidia.com/publication/2019-10_nvbit-dynamic-binary-instrumentation-framework-nvidia-gpus). 
The traces contain information about warps and the instructions they execute.

### Macsim Architecture
Macsim simulator consists of a trace reader (`trace.h`), several GPU cores (`core.cpp`), L1/L2 caches (`cache.cpp`) 
and a basic fixed latency memory (`ram.cpp`). Each core has a local L1 cache and all cores share an L2 cache. When we 
invoke macsim with a `kernel_config.txt` which contains the trace metadata, macsim retrieves information about how many 
kernels need to be executed and trace file for each warp. During simulation, macsim launches the kernels in a trace 
sequentially. In each kernel, macsim sets up the cores and caches. 

A cycle in macsim is simulated in `macsim::run_a_cycle()` method which performs the following actions:
- Incrementing the global cycle counter (`macsim::m_cycle`).
- Call `core::run_a_cycle()` for each core,
- Check if any memory responses have been returned from the memory subsystem and send them to the corresponding core. 

Each core mainly consists of an L1 cache, a dispatch queue (aka active warps pool, `core::c_dispatched_warps`), a 
suspended queue (`core::c_suspended_warps`), and a warp scheduler (`core.cpp::schedule_warps`). Since we are only concerned 
about the scheduling of warps and performance of different warp scheduling algorithms in terms of parameters like number 
of stall cycles, cache hits, etc. We only simulate load-store instructions and do not simulate any compute operations 
(like add, multiply etc.).

### Warp Scheduling in Macsim
Macsim uses a 2-level warp scheduling scheme as discussed in the lecture. The warp scheduler in a core is responsible 
to schedule one warp from the dispatch queue every cycle. The warp runs for exactly one cycle before going back to the 
dispatch queue (only 1 instruction is executed). If the instruction is a load/store instruction, we send a read/write 
request to the memory subsystem starting at the local L1 cache. In this case, instead of going back to the dispatch queue, 
it is moved to the suspended queue and it stays there until the response comes back from the memory subsystem. Upon 
receiving a response, the warp is moved to the dispatch queue again in the background. 

Therefore in summary, when the `core::run_a_cycle()` method is called, it performs the following actions:
- Checking if we got any responses from memory and moving the corresponding warps from suspended_queue to dispatch queue.
- Moving currently executing warp back to the dispatch queue.
- If there are no warps in both the dispatch queue and the suspended queue, then the core calls the `macsim::dispatch_warps()` method 
  to refill its dispatch queue.
- Scheduling a new warp from the dispatch queue using a warp scheduling policy.
- Executing 1 instruction for the scheduled warp.

A cycle is called a **stall cycle** if the warp scheduler fails to schedule a new warp (perhaps because all warps are 
in the suspended queue waiting for memory response).

When the `macsim::dispatch_warps()` method is called and there are no warps to be dispatched (i.e. Block pool is empty), the core **retires**.
The simulation ends when all the cores retire after executing the last kernel in the trace.

The following figure shows the overall simulation flow of Macsim.

## Prerequisites
- Linux-based OS/WSL with python3 and GNU C/C++ compiler is required.
- **Using PACE-ICE cluster:**
  - **Using PACE-ICE cluster:**
    - We recommend using the following settings while allocating a machine on PACE cluster (Interactive Shell/Desktop):
      - Node Type: CPU (first avail)
      - Cores Per Node: 2
      - Memory Per Core: 2 GB
  - Traces are located at `/storage/ice-shared/cs8803o21/macsim_traces`. The simulator will automatically pick them up.
- **Using your own machine**:
  - After running `make traces` command, traces will be automatically downloaded to the local `macsim_traces` directory.
  - Macsim needs zlib to uncompress trace files. zlib and correspoding headers can be installed using `$ sudo apt install zlib1g zlib1g-dev`.


> Note: Traces are ~150MB in size and may take a couple of minutes to download and uncompress.


You can either clone the repository or download a zip from GitHub.
```bash
$ git clone <url>           # Clone the repo
$ cd Macsim_cs8803      
```

Plotting graphs requires `matplotlib` package, we've provided a bash script that you can source to setup a local Python 
virtual environment.

```bash
$ source sourceme           # source the sourceme script to setup environment
```

## Build Instructions
```bash
$ make -j`nproc`            # Build Macsim
# OR
$ make DEBUG=1 -j`nproc`    # Build Macsim for debugging with GDB
```

Try `make help` to see what else the makefile can do!

## Running benchmarks and plotting results
To run a single benchmark trace use the following command:
```bash
$ ./macsim -g <GPU config> -t <trace_path/kernel_config.txt>
```
- GPU configs are XML files that define parameters such as the number of cores, scheduling algorithm to use, etc. These 
  are located under `xmls` directory. We've provided 2 XML configs which are identical except the warp scheduling 
  algorithm they use.
- Traces are located under `/storage/ice-shared/cs8803o21/macsim_traces` on the PACE cluster. If you are using a local
  machine, these will be downloaded to the `macsim_traces` directory.


---
### Makefile
For your convenience, we've provided Make targets to run all benchmarks and plot the results.
```bash
$ make task1            # Run the simulator for task-1
$ make task2            # Run the simulator for task-2
$ make task3            # Run the simulator for task-3
$ make task4            # Run the simulator for task-4
$ make plot                 # Generate plots
```
The first four commands will run macsim for all the benchmarks and will generate log files in the `log` directory.
The fifth command will pick up logs and plot the stats in a bar graph (output in the `log` directory).
